# YOLOv8 Training and Inference Process

I'll create a markdown file explaining each step in the YOLOv8 training and inference process based on your script.

# YOLOv8 Training and Inference Guide

This guide explains the process of training and running inference with YOLOv8 for object detection.

## 1. Environment Setup

### Hardware Check
First, we verify if NVIDIA GPU is available, as GPU acceleration significantly speeds up the training process:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

This command displays information about the available NVIDIA GPUs, including model, memory usage, and driver version.

### Installing YOLOv8
We install the Ultralytics package which contains the YOLOv8 implementation:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

After installation, we run system checks to verify that everything is properly configured:

```python
import ultralytics
ultralytics.checks()
```

This confirms the installation and checks hardware compatibility.

## 2. Data Preparation

### Accessing the Dataset
When using Google Colab, we mount Google Drive to access stored datasets:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

We verify that our dataset files are accessible:

```bash
ls /content/drive/MyDrive/yolo
```

### Configuring the Dataset
We create a YAML configuration file that defines the structure and classes of our dataset:

```python
import yaml

# Dataset configuration
data_yaml = {
    'path': dataset_root_dir,  # dataset root directory
    'train': 'train',          # train images folder
    'val': 'valid',            # validation images folder
    'nc': 9,                   # number of classes
    'names': ['button', 'card', 'field', 'heading', 'icon', 'image', 'link', 'paragraph', 'text']
}

# Save the configuration to a YAML file
with open('data.yaml', 'w') as outfile:
    yaml.dump(data_yaml, outfile, default_flow_style=False)
```

The YAML file tells YOLOv8 where to find the training and validation data and defines the object classes we want to detect.

## 3. Training the Model

We start the training process using the YOLOv8 command-line interface:

```bash
yolo train model=yolov8n.pt data=data.yaml epochs=300 imgsz=640 batch=16 name='my_yolo_training_run' patience=10
```

### Key Training Parameters:
- **model**: The pre-trained model to start with (yolov8n.pt is the smallest/fastest version)
- **data**: Path to our dataset configuration file
- **epochs**: Maximum number of training cycles (300)
- **imgsz**: Input image size (640×640 pixels)
- **batch**: Number of images processed in one forward/backward pass (16)
- **name**: Name for this training run (creates a folder with results)
- **patience**: Early stopping parameter - training stops if no improvement for this many epochs (10)

During training, YOLOv8 automatically:
- Loads and preprocesses images from our dataset
- Performs data augmentation to improve model generalization
- Updates model weights based on calculated loss
- Evaluates performance on validation data
- Saves the best model weights

## 4. Running Inference

After training, we use the best model weights to detect objects in new images:

```bash
yolo predict model=runs/detect/my_yolo_training_run/weights/best.pt source='/content/drive/MyDrive/yolo/predict.png' imgsz=640 conf=0.25 save=True
```

### Key Inference Parameters:
- **model**: Path to our trained model weights (best.pt)
- **source**: Input image, video, or folder to run detection on
- **imgsz**: Input image size (should match training size)
- **conf**: Confidence threshold (0.25 = 25% minimum confidence)
- **save**: Whether to save the output images with detection boxes

## 5. Viewing Results

The results can be viewed by opening the saved output images, which include bounding boxes around detected objects with class labels and confidence scores.

## Dataset Structure

For YOLOv8 training, the dataset should be organized as follows:

```
dataset_root_dir/
├── train/
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   ├── image2.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   └── labels/
│       ├── image1.txt
│       ├── image2.txt
│       └── ...
└── valid/
    ├── images/
    │   ├── image1.jpg
    │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── labels/
        ├── image1.txt
        ├── image2.txt
        └── ...
```

Each label file contains one line per object in the format:
`class_id x_center y_center width height`
where coordinates are normalized between 0 and 1.
